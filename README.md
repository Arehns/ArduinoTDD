INTRODUCTION
------------

The Administration Menu module displays the entire administrative menu tree
(and most local tasks) in a drop-down menu, providing administrators one- or
two-click access to most pages.  Other modules may also add menu links to the
menu using hook_admin_menu_output_alter().
